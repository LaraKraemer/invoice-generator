# PDF Invoice Generator
I am currently learning Python! This is a project from my python bootcamp 
where I generate a pdf invoice file. As a data source I work with xlsx files. The focus of the lectures was on learning and further practising for-loops.

If you like to automate your invoice process, clone this repo and have fun!

## How to work with this repository
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have the latest Python version. I worked with 3.12.
3. Open Project: `cd myproject`
4. Install venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
5. Run venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
6. Add: `yourfile.xlsx files`
7. Write more code, write the tests, and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
